Enable is a platform that empowers low-income women by providing access to credit and savings solutions. Women in the informal sector are often the bedrock of their families. Without access to funding, they unable to generate income to educate or sustain their children. These women are considered high credit risk to typical financial institutions because they are mostly unbanked, lack collateral and the means to access available credit. Enable seeks to bridge this gap by providing a verified database of potential beneficiaries of financial services and empowering them in the journey into financial inclusion. Financial services are tied to conditions to incentivize commitment to their childrenâ€™s education, good financial habits and collective responsibility.
